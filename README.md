Fully connected, simple neural network in modern c++

To compile on Compiler Explorer:
To compile for either the ARM Cortex-a72 (new raspberry pi) use gcc 8.2 (with -Os -std=c++17 -mtune=cortex-a72 or use -O3, which may give faster code, but more assembly) or for the X86-64, use gcc 9.1 (with -Os -std=c++17/2a -Wall -Wextra).

Need to complete feedForward function, followed by backPropagation function.
